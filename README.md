### Version
0.1.0

Presentation

1.0.0

In this version we have already created our application using 'yo cells-starter-kit'.
We have our application files & folders structure and can run 'sudo gulp serve' at the app folder to launch it.
By default gulp will use 'localhost:80' to serve the app and will launch our browser to see it.
At this point our app is 'empty', just with a default greeting component, so... is time to start including components.

2.0.0

For this example we have navigated to [cells catalog] looking for a nice and usefull component to start our app.
We've choosen 'buzz-ui-organism-welcome' and we have integrated it following the [guide2] instructions.
